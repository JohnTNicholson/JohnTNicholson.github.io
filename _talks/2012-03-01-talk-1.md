I gave this talk as part of the [Casual Math Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/casual-math-seminar/home) series. In the talk I gave an overview of the field of interactive theorem proving with a focus on the Lean theorem prover. Here is the abstract for the talk.  
**Abstract:** Computer proof assistants have recently gained traction in mainstream mathematical discourse. In this talk, we will delve into the concepts behind computer proof assistants, briefly survey the various proof assistants to choose from, and discuss some ongoing projects in the formalization of mathematics. We will conclude by proving some elementary results in Lean.
