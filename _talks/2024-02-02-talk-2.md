I gave this talk as part of the [McMaster Model Theory Seminar](https://math.mcmaster.ca/news-events/seminars-colloquia/model-theory-seminar-archive/) series. In this talk I gave an overview of the connections between the theory of regular tree languages and finite algebras, focusing on how these connections motivate my current research. Here is the abstract for the talk.  
**Abstract:** In this talk, I will introduce regular tree languages and demonstrate their connection with finite algebras. This leads to an algebraic construction originally studied by VanderWerf called a simulation class. I will highlight some key simulation classes that have deep links with universal algebra. One such simulation class is the class of all finite algebras that cannot simulate any finite group, called the class of aperiodic algebras. I will provide a brief survey of the connections between simulation classes and the logical definability of regular tree languages. I will conclude the talk with some recent work of my supervisor and mine concerning an open problem posed by VanderWerf about the simulation class of aperiodic algebras.
